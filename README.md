# ContainerManagement
Container management system when they arrive at the port.

The container management system, called "ContainerManagement", is a comprehensive solution designed to optimize logistics and workflow at container terminals. Its main functionality is to identify and track incoming containers, record the services to be carried out on each of them and monitor their final destination once these services have been completed.

Through an intuitive and integrated interface, port operators can easily record the arrival of containers, assign specific services to each one (such as inspections, repairs or temporary storage) and record information on the final destination of each container after the services have been completed.

With ContainerManagement, container terminals can significantly increase their productivity, improve the accuracy of container tracking and provide a more efficient and reliable service to customers.
